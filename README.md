# HackSecure-Internship
This is a one month long internship which took the interns through two different paths in cybersecuirty. The Red team and Blue team. I went through the Red team group and there were tasks setup for us to do and courses to guide us through the tasks.

The tasks for the red team involved ip address scanning for open ports, credentials capturing with wireshark, SQLi and JavaScript injection. The tasks still went ahead to involve little programming tasks; port scanner, password strenght checker, and encryption tool, to be made using python. Though this were the task that involved programming, The interns were required to do only one of the tasks.
